## About

The Readme Creator will allow a user to generate their very own readme through a series of inquirer questions. The application will then apply those answers to a new readme file. This way the user can spend less time on their readme and more time coding their application!

***
## Install

To install this app, clone this repo and run 
```
npm install
```

***
## Usage

To use this app, simply run
```
node index
```
in the vs terminal inside the file folder. Then read each inquirer question carefully and answer the questions about your project. Once you finish with the questions, a brand new readme file will be created for you!
